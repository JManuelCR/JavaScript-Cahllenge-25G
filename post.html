                  Burnout is tough. When you are burnt out from something, you resent it, and don't want touch it again. This unhealthy relationship with that thing only decreases your productivity and your mental health. Well, this exactly happened with me and programming. Learning to code over 2 years ago, I thought my relationship with code was great. In that short 1 year span that I did code, it was my #1 priority, making a stark imbalance in my life. This imbalance led me to not write another line of code for 2 years, until recently. After a long break, I feel the urge to come back into coding, and rekindle my passion that I used to love. In this article, I will go over the most important things that I kept in mind over this journey of relearning and rediscovering. I hope these help you too :

                    1. Address the reasons why you want to come back to coding

                  To make sure that you will have a healthy relationship with code, you need to make sure that you are coming back from burnout for yourself, and your needs. If you are doing it for other people, or purely for the sake of getting a job, for example, it will be much harder to devote time and effort into coding consistently. This would lead to another burnout, which is the main thing we are trying to avoid! In my case, I felt that I had extra time in my life, that I wanted to dedicate to a hobby. Since programming is something I used to love, I wanted to try it again, as in combination with me finding it very interesting and worthwhile, it is a practical skill for the future. In summary, make sure that you are coming back from burnout for you, and what you want to do. This will keep you motivated and interesting in coding.

                <h3><a href="">2. Make a plan</a></h3>
                <img src="https://picsum.photos/450/300"alt="">
                <p>
                  Learning to code, and relearning to code is no different, you need to make a plan! To make sure you aren't all over the place, scrambling to learn every technology that you knew previously, you need to assemble a plan. Something very common with burnout is feeling overwhelmed with all the things you need to do to get back to where you were prior. To prevent this feeling, you need to take it one step at a time, to make your foundations strong but also to maintain that healthy relationship. In my case, for the past few weeks, I've just been relearning Python, the first programming language I learned. Since Python is easy to learn, I thought it would be a logical starting point for me. Although my main programming language was Rust, I felt like that would be a harder starting point, leading to more roadblocks and possibly being overwhelmed. Before you start getting into coding again, outline the languages/concepts/frameworks you want to relearn, and the resources that you will use. This will keep you on track, but also prevent you from being overwhelmed as you have a clear plan to get back to where you were before. Furthermore, it's rewarding to tick off the tasks that you have completed, giving yourself more motivation to continue.
